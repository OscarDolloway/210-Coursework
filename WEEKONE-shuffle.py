#O = o(n) O notation â€“ O (n)
#This function shuffle which shuffles the array by the length of the list, I chose the length of the list so if the list was bigger it would get shuffled more times which I believe is efficient. 
#The o notation of this code is o(N) as the size of the list is N it could be any size therefore the result is o(n).
